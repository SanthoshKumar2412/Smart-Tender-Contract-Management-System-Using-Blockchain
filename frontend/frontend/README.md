# Smart-Tender-Contract-Management-System-Using-Blockchain
This project is a decentralized application (DApp) for managing tenders and contracts using blockchain technology. The system aims to provide a transparent, secure, and efficient platform for organizations to create tenders, receive bids, and manage contracts, leveraging the immutability and transparency of blockchain.

- **Bid Approval:** Admin can review and approve bids based on criteria such as bid amount, vendor reputation, and compliance with tender requirements.
- **Contract Management:** Manage contracts resulting from approved bids, including contract details, signing, and execution.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Utilizes blockchain technology (such as Ethereum) for secure and transparent record-keeping of tender and contract-related transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Angular
